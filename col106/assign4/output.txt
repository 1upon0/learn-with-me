                 NOTES, DEFINITIONS, AND ABBREVIATIONS

There have been some significant changes in this edition. The Trust
Territory of the Pacific Islands became the independent nation of
Palau. The gross domestic product (GDP) of all countries is now
presented on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis rather than on the
old exchange rate basis. There is a new entry on Age structure and the
Airports entry now includes unpaved runways. The Communications
category has been restructured and now includes the entries of
Telephone system, Radio, and Television. The remainder of the entries
in the former Communications category-Railroads, Highways, Inland
waterways, Pipelines, Ports, Merchant marine, and Airports-can now be
found under a new category called Transportation. There is a new
appendix listing estimates of gross domestic product on an exchange
rate basis for all nations. A reference map of the Republic of South
Africa is included. The electronic files used to produce the Factbook
have been restructured into a database. As a result, the formats of
some entries in this edition have been changed. Additional changes
will occur in the 1996 Factbook.

Administrative divisions: The numbers, designatory terms, and
first-order administrative divisions are generally those approved by
the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been
reported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted.

Airports: Only airports with usable runways are included in this
listing. For airports with more than one runway, only the longest
runway is included. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,
maintenance, or air traffic control. Paved runways have concrete or
asphalt surfaces; unpaved runways have grass, dirt, sand, or gravel
surfaces.

Area: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by
international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate
of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or
coastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).
Comparative areas are based on total area equivalents. Most entities
are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states. The smaller
entities are compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The
Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).

Birth rate: The average annual number of births during a year per
1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate. Dates of
information: In general, information available as of 1 January 1995 is
used in the preparation of this edition. Population figures are
estimates for 1 July 1995, with population growth rates estimated for
calendar year 1995. Major political events have been updated through
April 1995.

Death rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year per
l,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate.

Digraphs: The digraph is a two-letter "country code" that precisely
identifies every entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. AF,
for example, is the digraph for Afghanistan. It is a standardized
geopolitical data element promulgated in the Federal Information
Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 10-3 by the National Bureau of
Standards (now called National Institute of Standards and Technology)
at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the Office of the
Geographer at the US Department of State. The digraph is used to
eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the collection, processing,
and dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly useful for
interchanging data between databases.

Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations
with 184 nations, including 178 of the 185 UN members (excluded UN
members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, former Yugoslavia,
and the US itself). In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with
6 nations that are not in the UN - Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru,
Switzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu.

Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official
development assistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF). ODA is
defined as financial assistance which is concessional in character,
has the main objective to promote economic development and welfare of
LDCs, and contains a grant element of at least 25%. OOF transactions
are also official government assistance, but with a main objective
other than development and with a grant element less than 25%. OOF
transactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im Bank
credits), official equity and portfolio investment, and debt
reorganization by the official sector that does not meet concessional
terms. Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are
initialed by the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration
of intent.

Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special
sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not
independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US
Government. "Nation" refers to a people politically organized into a
sovereign state with a definite territory. "Dependent area" refers to
a broad category of political entities that are associated in some way
with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually the short-form
names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. There are 266
entities in The World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:

Exchange rate:
The official value of a nation's monetary unit at a given date or over
a given period of time, as expressed in units of local currency per US
dollar and as determined by international market forces or official
fiat.

GDP methodology: In the "Economy" section, GDP dollar estimates for
all countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP)
calculations rather than from conversions at official currency
exchange rates. The PPP method normally involves the use of
international dollar price weights, which are applied to the
quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy. In
addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries,
the statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying, identifying,
and allowing for the quality of goods and services. The division of a
GDP estimate in local currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in
dollars gives the PPP conversion rate. On average, one thousand
dollars will buy the same market basket of goods in the US as one
thousand dollars - converted to the local currency at the PPP
conversion rate - will buy in the other country. Whereas PPP estimates
for OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing
countries are often rough approximations. Most of the GDP estimates
are based on extrapolation of numbers published by the UN
International Comparison Program and by Professors Robert Summers and
Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues.
Currency exchange rates depend on a variety of international and
domestic financial forces that often have little relation to domestic
output. In developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate
estimate of GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP
estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by
10% or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas real
output has remained unchanged. On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14
countries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are
tied to the French franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move,
of course, did not cut the real output of these countries by half. One
important caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a
percentage of GDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially
from the proportion when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as,
for example, when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of
Russian or Japanese military expenditures. Note: The numbers for GDP
and other economic data can not be chained together from successive
volumes of the Factbook because of changes in the US dollar measuring
rod, revisions of data by statistical agencies, use of new or
different sources of information, and changes in national statistical
methods and practices.

Gross domestic product (GDP): The value of all final goods and
services produced within a nation in a given year.

Gross national product (GNP): The value of all final goods and
services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned
abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic production.

Gross world product (GWP): The aggregate value of all goods and
services produced worldwide in a given year.

Growth rate (population): The annual percent change in the population,
resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the
balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be
positive or negative.

Illicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit drugs - narcotics,
stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis.
These categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by
doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold outside medical
channels.
Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides
hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana
(pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC,
Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).
Coca (Erythroxylum coca) is a bush, and the leaves contain the
stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa,
which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa,
and cocoa butter.
Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.
Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and
include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,
phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone
(Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,
Valmid). Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical,
mental, emotional, or behavioral change in an individual. Drug abuse
is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that results in
physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an
individual. Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,
self-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid,
microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine
variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog),
phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin,
psilocyn).
Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant
(Cannabis sativa).
Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.
Mandrax is the Southwest Asian slang term for methaqualone, a
pharmaceutical depressant.
Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis
sativa).
Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, in slang referred to as
Quaaludes in North America or Mandrax in Southwest Asia Narcotics are
drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to opium, opium
derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include
opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol),
codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC),
and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack),
and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics include meperidine
or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose),
and others (Darvon, Lomotil).
Opium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the opium
poppy. Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural
and semisynthetic narcotics. Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid
derived from the mature dried opium poppy.
Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of catha edulis
that is chewed or drunk as tea.
Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a
pharmaceutical depressant.
Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and
activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines
(Desoxyn, Dexedrine), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate
(Ritalin), and others (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).

Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year
old in a given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same year.

International disputes: This category includes a wide variety of
situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to
unilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding
disputes over international boundaries and maritime boundaries has
been reviewed by the Department of State. References to other
situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such
as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues.
However, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance
or recognition by the US Government.

Irrigated land: The figure refers to the land area that is
artificially supplied with water.

Land use: The land surface is categorized as arable land - land
cultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest (wheat,
maize, rice); permanent crops - land cultivated for crops that are not
replanted after each harvest (citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and
pastures - land permanently used for herbaceous forage crops; forest
and woodland - under dense or open stands of trees; and other - any
land type not specifically mentioned above (urban areas, roads,
desert).

Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who
represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but is not
involved with the day- to-day activities of the government. The head
of government is the administrative leader who manages the day-to-day
activities of the government. In the UK, the monarch is the chief of
state, and the Prime Minister is the head of government. In the US,
the President is both the chief of state and the head of government.

Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by a
group of people all born in the same year, if mortality at each age
remains constant in the future.

Literacy: There are no universal definitions and standards of
literacy. Unless otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most
common definition - the ability to read and write at a specified age.
Detailing the standards that individual countries use to assess the
ability to read and write is beyond the scope of this publication.

Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some
national claims from being extended the full distance.

Merchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All
commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which
excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc. Also, a
grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register.
Captive register - A register of ships maintained by a territory,
possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships
owned in the parent country; also referred to as an offshore register,
the offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive
register will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local
variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation
rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a captive
register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent
country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned
abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience
register, except that it is not the register of an independent state.
Flag of convenience register - A national register offering
registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major
flags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue
of low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal
manning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having
relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag
state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a
given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority
of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an
open register.
Flag state - The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds
legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or
abroad. Flag state maritime legislation determines how a ship is
manned and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the
register.
Internal register - A register of ships maintained as a subset of a
national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national
flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of
maritime rules from those on the main national register. These
differences usually include lower taxation of profits, manning by
foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag state
(when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International
Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most
notable examples of an internal register. Both have been instrumental
in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and
in attracting foreign owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags.
Merchant ship - A vessel that carries goods against payment of
freight; commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately
restricted to commercial vessels only.
Register - The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed
with the maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of
such individual ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides
it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the country
in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the nationality of
the ship's ultimate owner.

Money figures: All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US
dollars unless otherwise indicated.

National product: The total output of goods and services in a country
in a given year. See GDP methodology, Gross domestic product (GDP),
and Gross national product (GNP).

Net migration rate: The balance between the number of persons entering
and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on
midyear population). An excess of persons entering the country is
referred to as net immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an
excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration (-9.26
migrants/1,000 population).

Population: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based
on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration
systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on
assumptions about future trends. Starting with the 1993 Factbook,
demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African) have taken
into account the effects of the growing incidence of AIDS infections;
in 1993 these countries were Burkina, Burundi, Central African
Republic, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania,
Uganda, Zaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Thailand, Brazil, and Haiti.

Telephone numbers: All telephone numbers presented in the Factbook
consist of the country code in brackets, the city or area code (where
required) in parentheses, and the local number. The one component that
is not presented is the international access code which varies from
country to country. For example, an international direct dial phone
call placed from the United States to Madrid, Spain, would be as
follows:

    011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx where
    011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls
    (01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls),
    [34] is the country code for Spain,
    (1) is the city code for Madrid,
    577 is the local exchange,
    and xxxx is the local telephone number.

An international direct dial phone call placed from another country to
the United States would be as follows:

international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx where
    [1] is the country code for the United States,
    (202) is the area code for Washington, DC,
    939 is the local exchange,
    and xxxx is the local telephone number.

Total fertility rate: The average number of children that would be
born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing
years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each
age. Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless
indicated as fiscal year (FY). FY93/94 refers to the fiscal year that
began in calendar year 1993 and ended in calendar year 1994 as defined
in the Fiscal Year entry of the Economy section for each nation.
FY90-94 refers to the four fiscal years that began in calendar year
1990 and ended in calendar year 1994.

Note: Information for the US and US dependencies was compiled from
material in the public domain and does not represent Intelligence
Community estimates. The Handbook of International Economic
Statistics, published annually in September by the Central
Intelligence Agency, contains detailed economic information for the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
countries, Eastern Europe, the newly independent republics of the
former nations of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and selected other
countries. The Handbook can be obtained wherever The World Factbook is
available.

 to a two-year term by a national shura, later amended by multi-party
 agreement to 18 months; note - in June 1994 failure to agree on a

 continues in office head of government: Prime Minister of the Council
 of Ministers Aleksander Gabriel MEKSI (since 10 April 1992)

@Afghanistan:Economy

 Overview: Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked country, highly
 dependent on farming (wheat especially) and livestock raising (sheep
 and goats). Economic considerations have played second fiddle to
 political and military upheavals during more than 15 years of war,
 including the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended
 15 February 1989). Over the past decade, one-third of the population
 fled the country, with Pakistan sheltering more than 3 million
 refugees and Iran about 3 million. About 1.4 million Afghan refugees
 remain in Pakistan and about 2 million in Iran. Another 1 million
 probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan.
 Although reliable data are unavailable, gross domestic product is
 lower than 13 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and
 the disruption of trade and transport.

@Albania:Economy

 Overview: An extremely poor country by European standards, Albania is
 making the difficult transition to a more open-market economy. The
 economy rebounded in 1993-94 after a severe depression accompanying
 the collapse of the previous centrally planned system in 1990 and
 1991. Stabilization policies - including a strict monetary policy,
 public sector layoffs, and reduced social services - have improved the
 government's fiscal situation and reduced inflation. The recovery was
 spurred by the remittances of some 20% of the population which works
 abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP
 and help offset the large foreign trade deficit. Foreign assistance
 and humanitarian aid also supported the recovery. Most agricultural
 land was privatized in 1992, substantially improving peasant incomes.
 Albania's limited industrial sector, now less than one-sixth of GDP,
 continued to decline in 1994. A sharp fall in chromium prices reduced
 hard currency receipts from the mining sector. Large segments of the
 population, especially those living in urban areas, continue to depend
 on humanitarian aid to meet basic food requirements. Unemployment
 remains a severe problem accounting for approximately one-fifth of the
 work force. Growth is expected to continue in 1995, but could falter
 if Albania becomes involved in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia,
 workers' remittances from Greece are reduced, or foreign assistance
 declines.

@Algeria:Economy

 Overview: The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the economy,
 accounting for roughly 57% of government revenues, 25% of GDP, and
 almost all export earnings; Algeria has the fifth largest reserves of
 natural gas in the world and ranks fourteenth for oil. Algiers'
 efforts to reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the
 Arab world began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged
 the country into a severe recession. In 1989, the government launched
 a comprehensive, IMF-supported program to achieve macroeconomic
 stabilization and to introduce market mechanisms into the economy.
 Despite substantial progress toward macroeconomic adjustment, in 1992
 the reform drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political
 turmoil. In September 1993, a new government was formed, and one
 priority was the resumption and acceleration of the structural
 adjustment process. Buffeted by the slump in world oil prices and
 burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year
 standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994.

@Andorra:Economy

 Overview: Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's economy, accounts for
 roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 13 million tourists visit annually,
 attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter
 resorts. The banking sector, with its "tax haven" status, also
 contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is
 limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be
 imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.
 Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.
 Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union; it is unclear what effect
 the European Single Market will have on the advantages Andorra obtains
 from its duty-free status.

@Angola:Government

 Note: Civil war has been the norm since independence from Portugal on
 11 November 1975; a cease-fire lasted from 31 May 1991 until October
 1992 when the insurgent National Union for the Total Independence of
 Angola (UNITA) refused to accept its defeat in internationally
 monitored elections and fighting resumed throughout much of the
 countryside. The two sides signed another peace accord on 20 November
 1994; the cease-fire is generally holding but most provisions of the
 accord remain to be implemented.

@Angola:Economy

 Overview: Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for
 80%-90% of the population but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil
 production is vital to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP.
 Despite the signing of a peace accord in November 1994 between the
 Angola government and the UNITA insurgents, sporadic fighting
 continues and many farmers remain reluctant to return to their fields.
 As a result, much of the country's food requirements must still be
 imported. Angola has rich natural resources - notably gold, diamonds,
 and arable land, in addition to large oil deposits - but will need to
 observe the cease-fire, implement the peace agreement, and reform
 government policies if it is to achieve its potential.

ANTARCTICA

@Antarctica:Geography

 Location: continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle

 Map references: Antarctic Region

 Area:
 total area: 14 million sq km (est.)
 land area: 14 million sq km (est.)
 comparative area: slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US
 note: second-smallest continent (after Australia)

 Land boundaries: none, but see entry on International disputes

 Coastline: 17,968 km

 Maritime claims: none, but see entry on International Disputes

 International disputes: Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see Antarctic
 Treaty Summary below); sections (some overlapping) claimed by
 Argentina, Australia, Chile, France (Adelie Land), New Zealand (Ross
 Dependency), Norway (Queen Maud Land), and UK; the US and most other
 nations do not recognize the territorial claims of other nations and
 have made no claims themselves (the US reserves the right to do so);
 no formal claims have been made in the sector between 90 degrees west
 and 150 degrees west

 Climate: severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and
 distance from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West
 Antarctica because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has
 the most moderate climate; higher temperatures occur in January along
 the coast and average slightly below freezing

 Terrain: about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock,
 with average elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain
 ranges up to 4,897 meters high; ice-free coastal areas include parts
 of southern Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area,
 and parts of Ross Island on McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves
 along about half of the coastline, and floating ice shelves constitute
 11% of the area of the continent

 Natural resources: none presently exploited; iron ore, chromium,
 copper, gold, nickel, platinum and other minerals, and coal and
 hydrocarbons have been found in small, uncommercial quantities

 Land use:
 arable land: 0%
 permanent crops: 0%
 meadows and pastures: 0%
 forest and woodland: 0%
 other: 100% (ice 98%, barren rock 2%)

 Irrigated land: 0 sq km

 Environment:
 current issues: in October 1991 it was reported that the ozone shield,
 which protects the Earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation,
 had dwindled to the lowest level recorded over Antarctica since 1975
 when measurements were first taken
 natural hazards: katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from
 the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the
 plateau; cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise along
 the coast; volcanism on Deception Island and isolated areas of West
 Antarctica; other seismic activity rare and weak
 international agreements: NA

 Note: the coldest, windiest, highest, and driest continent; during
 summer more solar radiation reaches the surface at the South Pole than
 is received at the Equator in an equivalent period; mostly
 uninhabitable

 Article 6: includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves south of
 60 degrees 00 minutes south
 Article 7: treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial
 observation, to any area and may inspect all stations, installations,
 and equipment; advance notice of all activities and of the
 introduction of military personnel must be given
 Article 8: allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by
 their own states
 Article 9: frequent consultative meetings take place among member
 nations
 Article 10: treaty states will discourage activities by any country in
 Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty
 Article 11: disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned
 or, ultimately, by the ICJ
 Articles 12, 13, 14: deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending
 the treaty among involved nations
 Other agreements: more than 170 recommendations adopted at treaty
 consultative meetings and ratified by governments include - Agreed
 Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964);
 Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention
 on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (1980); a
 mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988 but was subsequently
 rejected; in 1991 the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the
 Antarctic Treaty was signed and awaits ratification; this agreement
 provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment through five
 specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna, and flora, environmental
 impact assessments, waste management, and protected areas; it also
 prohibits all activities relating to mineral resources except
 scientific research; 14 parties have ratified Protocol as of April
 1995

 Legal system: US law, including certain criminal offenses by or
 against US nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under
 jurisdiction of other countries. Some US laws directly apply to
 Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.
 section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the
 following activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute: The
 taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of nonindigenous
 plants and animals; entry into specially protected or scientific
 areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the importation
 into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation of the
 Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in fines
 and 1 year in prison. The Departments of Treasury, Commerce,
 Transportation, and Interior share enforcement responsibilities.
 Public Law 95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, requires
 expeditions from the US to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the
 Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room 5801, Department of State,
 Washington, DC 20520, which reports such plans to other nations as
 required by the Antarctic Treaty. For more information contact Permit
 Office, Office of Polar Programs, National Science Foundation,

@Argentina:Economy

 Overview: Argentina, rich in natural resources, benefits also from a
 highly literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector,
 and a diversified industrial base. Nevertheless, following decades of
 mismanagement and statist policies, the economy in the late 1980s was
 plagued with huge external debts and recurring bouts of
 hyperinflation. Elected in 1989, in the depths of recession, President
 MENEM has implemented a comprehensive economic restructuring program
 that shows signs of putting Argentina on a path of stable, sustainable
 growth. Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US dollar
 since April 1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20
 years. Argentines have responded to the relative price stability by
 repatriating flight capital and investing in domestic industry. The
 economy registered an impressive 6% advance in 1994, fueled largely by
 inflows of foreign capital and strong domestic consumption spending.
 The government's major short term objective is encouraging exports,
 e.g., by reducing domestic costs of production. At the start of 1995,
 the government had to deal with the spillover from international
 financial movements associated with the devaluation of the Mexican
 peso. In addition, unemployment had become a serious issue for the
 government. Despite average annual 7% growth in 1991-94, unemployment
 surprisingly has doubled - due mostly to layoffs in government bureaus
 and in privatized industrial firms and utilities and, to a lesser
 degree, to illegal immigration. Much remains to be done in the 1990s
 in dismantling the old statist barriers to growth, extending the
 recent economic gains, and bringing down the rate of unemployment.

@Armenia:Economy

 Overview: Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had
 developed a more modern industrial sector, supplying machine building
 equipment, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics
 in exchange for raw materials and energy resources. Armenia is a large
 food importer and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The
 economic decline in recent years (1991-94) has been particularly
 severe due to the ongoing conflict over the ethnic Armenian-dominated
 region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and Turkey have
 blockaded pipeline and railroad traffic to Armenia for its support of
 the Karabakh Armenians. This has left Armenia with chronic energy
 shortages because of a lack of capacity and frequent disruptions of
 natural gas deliveries through unstable Georgia, as well as
 difficulties in obtaining other types of fuel. In addition, bread is
 strictly rationed and there are shortages of other goods. In 1994, the
 economy seemed to bottom out. The government has managed to increase
 its financial and budgetary discipline, bringing inflation down from
 around 40% per month in first half 1994 to single digits in second
 half 1994 and the first quarter of 1995. A full economic recovery
 cannot be expected until the conflict is settled and the blockade
 lifted.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $8.1 billion (1994
 estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)

 National product real growth rate: -2% (1994 est.)

 National product per capita: $2,290 (1994 est.)

 Inflation rate (consumer prices): 27% per month average (1994 est.)

 Unemployment rate: 6.5% of officially registered unemployed but large
 numbers of underemployed (1994 est.)

 Budget:

 expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA

 Exports: $43 million to countries outside the FSU (f.o.b., 1994)
 commodities: gold and jewelry, aluminum, transport equipment,
 electrical equipment

 Imports: $120 million from countries outside the FSU (c.i.f., 1994)
 commodities: grain, other foods, fuel, other energy

 External debt: $NA

 Industrial production: growth rate 7% (1994 est.); accounts for 41% of
 GDP

 Electricity:
 capacity: 4,620,000 kW
 production: 5.7 billion kWh
 consumption per capita: 1,620 kWh (1994)

 Industries: traditionally diverse, including (as a percent of output
 of former USSR) metalcutting machine tools (5.5%), forging-pressing
 machines (1.9%), electric motors (9%), tires (1.5%), knitted wear
 (4.4%), hosiery (3.0%), shoes (2.2%), silk fabric (0.8%), washing
 machines (2.0%), chemicals, trucks, watches, instruments, and
 microelectronics (1990); currently, much of industry is shut down

 Agriculture: only 17% of land area is arable; employs 31% of labor
 force as residents increasingly turn to subsistence agriculture;
 fruits (especially grapes) and vegetable farming, minor livestock
 sector; vineyards near Yerevan are famous for brandy and other
 liqueurs

 Illicit drugs: illicit cultivator of cannabis mostly for domestic
 consumption; used as a transshipment point for illicit drugs to
 Western Europe

 Economic aid:
 recipient: considerable humanitarian aid, mostly food and energy
 products, from US and EU; Russia granted 60 billion rubles in
 technical credits in late 1994 and approved a 110 billion ruble credit
 almost half of which was to go toward the restart of the Metsamor
 nuclear power plant

@Aruba:Economy

 Overview: Tourism is the mainstay of the Aruban economy, although
 offshore banking and oil refining and storage are also important. The
 rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last decade has resulted
 in a substantial expansion of other activities. Construction has
 boomed, with hotel capacity five times the 1985 level. Additionally,
 the reopening of the country's oil refinery in 1993, a major source of
 employment and foreign exchange earnings, has further spurred growth.
 Aruba's small labor force and less than 1% unemployment rate have led
 to a large number of unfilled job vacancies despite sharp rises in
 wage rates in recent years.

@Australia:Economy

 Overview: Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy,
 with a per capita GDP comparable to levels in industrialized West
 European countries. Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major
 exporter of agricultural products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels.
 Primary products account for more than 60% of the value of total
 exports, so that, as in 1983-84, a downturn in world commodity prices
 can have a big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for
 increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in
 international markets continues to be severe. Australia has suffered
 from the low growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD
 countries in the early 1990s. In 1992-93 the economy recovered slowly
 from the prolonged recession of 1990-91, a major restraining factor
 being weak world demand for Australia's exports. Growth picked up so
 strongly in 1994 that the government felt the need for fiscal and
 monetary tightening by yearend. Australia's GDP grew 6.4% in 1994,
 largely due to increases in industrial output and business investment.
 A severe drought in 1994 is expected to reduce the value of
 Australia's net farm production by $825 million in the twelve months
 through June 1995, but rising world commodity prices are likely to
 boost rural exports by 7.7% to $14.5 billion in 1995/96, according to
 government statistics.

@Austria:Economy

 Overview: Austria boasts a prosperous and stable market economy with a
 sizable but falling proportion of nationalized industry and with
 extensive welfare benefits. Thanks to its raw material endowment, a
 technically skilled labor force, and strong links to German industrial
 firms, Austria occupies specialized niches in European industry and
 services (tourism, banking) and produces almost enough food to feed
 itself with only 8% of the labor force in agriculture. After 11
 consecutive years of growth, the Austrian economy experienced a mild
 recession in 1993, but growth resumed in 1994. Unemployment is 4.3%
 and will likely stay at that level as companies adjust to the
 competition of EU membership beginning 1 January 1995. To prepare for
 EU membership, Austria's government has taken measures to open the
 economy by introducing a major tax reform, privatizing state-owned
 firms, and liberalizing cross-border capital movements. Problems for
 the 1990s include an aging population, the high level of industrial
 subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budgetary
 capabilities - the deficit climbed to over 4% of GDP in 1994.

AZERBAIJAN

 Note--Azerbaijan continues to be plagued by an unresolved
 seven-year-old conflict with Armenian separatists over its
 Nagorno-Karabakh region. The Karabakh Armenians have declared
 independence and seized almost 20% of the country's territory,
 creating almost 1 million Azeri displaced persons in the process. Both
 sides have generally observed a Russian-mediated cease-fire in place
 since May 1994, and support the OSCE-mediated peace process, now
 entering its fourth year. Nevertheless, Baku and Xankandi
 (Stepanakert) remain far apart on most substantive issues from the
 placement and composition of a peacekeeping force to the enclave's
 ultimate political status, and prospects for a negotiated settlement
 remain dim.

@Azerbaijan:Geography

 Location: Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran
 and Russia

 Area:
 total area: 86,600 sq km
 land area: 86,100 sq km

@Azerbaijan:Economy

 Overview: Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either
 Armenia or Georgia, the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the
 Central Asian states in its majority nominally Muslim population, high
 structural unemployment, and low standard of living. The economy's
 most prominent products are oil, cotton, and gas. Production from the
 Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline for several years, but
 the November 1994 ratification of the $7.5 billion oil deal with a
 consortium of Western companies should generate the funds needed to
 spur future industrial development. Azerbaijan accounted for 1.5% to
 2% of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet Union.
 Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet
 republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy,
 but its considerable energy resources brighten its long-term
 prospects. Baku has only recently begun making progress on economic
 reform, and old economic ties and structures have yet to be replaced.

@Bahrain:Economy

 Overview: Tiny in area, Bahrain is well-to-do in economic resources
 and per capita income. Petroleum production and processing account for
 about 80% of export receipts, 60% of government revenues, and 30% of
 GDP. Economic conditions have fluctuated with the changing fortunes of
 oil since 1985, for example, during and following the Gulf crisis of
 1990-91. With its highly developed communication and transport
 facilities Bahrain is home to numerous multinational firms with
 business in the Gulf. A large share of exports consists of petroleum
 products made from imported crude. Prospects for 1995 are good, with
 private enterprise the main driving force, e.g., in banking and
 construction. Unemployment, especially among the young, and the
 depletion of both oil and underground water resources are major
 long-term economic problems.

@Bangladesh:Economy

 Overview: Despite sustained domestic and international efforts to
 improve economic and demographic prospects, Bangladesh remains one of
 the world's poorest, most densely populated, and least developed
 nations. Its economy is overwhelmingly agricultural, with the
 cultivation of rice the single most important activity in the economy.
 Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, the
 inefficiency of state-owned enterprises, a rapidly growing labor force
 that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, delays in exploiting energy
 resources (natural gas), and inadequate power supplies. Excellent rice
 crops and expansion of the export garment industry led to real growth
 of 4% in 1992 and again in 1993. Policy measures intended to reduce
 government regulation of private industry, to curb population growth,
 and to expand employment opportunities have had only partial success
 given the serious nature of Bangladesh's basic problems.

@Barbados:Economy

 Overview: A per capita income of $9,200 gives Barbados one of the
 highest standards of living of all the small island states of the
 eastern Caribbean. Historically, the economy was based on the
 cultivation of sugarcane and related activities. In recent years,
 however, the economy has diversified into manufacturing and tourism. A
 moderate recovery that began in late 1993 after 3 years of contraction
 is mainly due to increased tourism and expansion in the construction
 sector. Economic prospects for 1995 depend mostly on continued growth
 in the industrialized countries, especially in Europe, which would
 spur further expansion in tourism.

@Belarus:Economy

 Overview: Belarus ranks among the most developed of the former Soviet
 states, with a relatively modern - by Soviet standards - and diverse
 machine building sector and a robust agriculture sector. It also
 serves as a transport link for Russian oil exports to the Baltic
 states and Eastern and Western Europe. The breakup of the Soviet Union
 and its command economy has resulted in a sharp economic contraction
 as traditional trade ties have collapsed. The Belarusian government
 has lagged behind the governments of most other former Soviet states
 in economic reform, with privatization almost nonexistent. The system
 of state orders and distribution persists. In mid-1994, the Belarusian
 government embarked on an austerity program with IMF support to slash
 state credits and consumer subsidies in order to bring down the budget
 deficit and reduce inflation. However, despite its promising start,
 the regime's drive to reinvigorate the economy has fallen short, and
 the IMF has criticized its failure to implement the reforms that the
 Fund had negotiated. As a result, the IMF has suspended talks on
 introducing a stand-by arrangement. Economic relations with Russia,
 which will have an important bearing on the future course of the
 economy, will be strengthened if Minsk adopts the necessary
 legislation to implement a customs union agreed to in January 1995.

@Belgium:Economy

 Overview: This small private enterprise economy has capitalized on its
 central geographic location, highly developed transport network, and
 diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated
 mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north, although the
 government is encouraging reinvestment in the southern region of
 Walloon. With few natural resources Belgium must import substantial
 quantities of raw materials and export a large volume of manufactures,
 making its economy unusually dependent on the state of world markets.
 Three-fourths of its trade is with other EU countries. The economy
 grew at a strong 4% pace during the period 1988-90, slowed to 1% in
 1991-92, dropped by 1.5% in 1993, and recovered with 2.3% growth in
 1994. Belgium's public debt has risen to 140% of GDP, and the
 government is trying to control its expenditures to bring the figure
 more into line with other industrialized countries.

@Benin:Economy

 Overview: The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on
 subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. Growth
 in real output has averaged a sound 4% in 1991-94 but this rate barely
 exceeds the rapid population growth of 3.3%. Inflation jumped to 35%
 in 1994 (compared to 3% in 1993) following the 50% currency
 devaluation in January. Commercial and transport activities, which
 make up almost 36% of GDP, are extremely vulnerable to developments in
 Nigeria as evidenced by decreased reexport trade in 1994 due to a
 severe contraction in Nigerian demand. The industrial sector accounts
 for less than 10% of GDP and mainly produces foods, beverages, cement,
 and textiles. Support by the Paris Club and official bilateral
 creditors has eased the external debt situation in recent years. The
 government, still burdened with money-losing state enterprises and a
 bloated civil service, is gradually implementing a World Bank
 supported structural adjustment program.

@Bhutan:Economy

 Overview: The economy, one of the world's least developed, is based on
 agriculture and forestry, which provide the main livelihood for 90% of
 the population and account for about half of GDP. Agriculture consists
 largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Rugged mountains
 dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other
 infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely aligned
 with India's through strong trade and monetary links. The industrial
 sector is small and technologically backward, with most production of
 the cottage industry type. Most development projects, such as road
 construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower
 potential and its attraction for tourists are key resources; however,
 the government limits the number of tourists to 4,000 per year to
 minimize foreign influence. Much of the impetus for growth has come
 from large public-sector companies. Nevertheless, in recent years,
 Bhutan has shifted toward decentralized development planning and
 greater private initiative. The government privatized several large
 public-sector firms, is revamping its trade regime and liberalizing
 administerial procedures over industrial licensing. The government's
 industrial contribution to GDP decreased from 13% in 1988 to about 11%
 in 1993.

@Bolivia:Economy

 Overview: With its long history of semifeudal social controls,
 dependence on volatile prices for its mineral exports, and bouts of
 hyperinflation, Bolivia has remained one of the poorest and least
 developed Latin American countries. However, Bolivia has experienced
 generally improving economic conditions since the PAZ Estenssoro
 administration (1985-89) introduced market-oriented policies which
 reduced inflation from 11,700% in 1985 to about 20% in 1988. PAZ
 Estenssoro was followed as President by Jaime PAZ Zamora (1989-93) who
 continued the free-market policies of his predecessor, despite
 opposition from his own party and from Bolivia's once powerful labor
 movement. By maintaining fiscal discipline, PAZ Zamora helped reduce
 inflation to 9.3% in 1993, while GDP grew by an annual average of
 3.25% during his tenure. Inaugurated in August 1993, President SANCHEZ
 DE LOZADA has vowed to advance the market-oriented economic reforms he
 helped launch as PAZ Estenssoro's planning minister. His successes so
 far have included an inflation rate that continues to decrease - the
 1994 rate of 8.5% was the lowest in ten years - the signing of a free
 trade agreement with Mexico, and progress on his unique privatization
 plan. The main privatization bill was passed by the Bolivian
 legislature in late March 1994. Related laws - one that establishes
 SIRESE, the regulatory agency that will oversee the privatizations,
 and another that outlines the rules for privatization in the
 electricity sector - were approved later in the year.

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

 Note--Bosnia and Herzegovina is set to enter its third year of
 interethnic civil strife which began in the spring of 1992 after the
 Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina held a referendum on
 independence. Bosnia's Serbs - supported by neighboring Serbia -
 responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the republic
 along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to 'greater Serbia'. In
 March 1994, Bosnia's Muslims and Croats reduced the number of warring
 factions from three to two by signing an agreement in Washington, DC,
 creating the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A group of rebel
 Muslims, however, continues to battle government forces in the
 northwest enclave of Bihac. A Contact Group of countries, the US, UK,
 France, Germany, and Russia, continues to seek a resolution between
 the Federation and the Bosnian Serbs. In July of 1994 the Contact
 Group presented a plan to the warring parties that roughly equally
 divides the country between the two, while maintaining Bosnia in its
 current internationally recognized borders. The Federation agreed to
 the plan almost immediately, while the Bosnian Serbs rejected it.

@Bosnia And Herzegovina:Economy

 Overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former Yugoslav
 Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old Yugoslav
 federation. Although agriculture has been almost all in private hands,
 farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic traditionally
 has been a net importer of food. Industry has been greatly
 overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central
 planning and management. TITO had pushed the development of military
 industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large
 share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of February 1995, Bosnia and
 Herzegovina was being torn apart by the continued bitter interethnic
 warfare that has caused production to plummet, unemployment and
 inflation to soar, and human misery to multiply. No economic
 statistics for 1992-94 are available, although output clearly has
 fallen substantially below the levels of earlier years and almost
 certainly is well below $1,000 per head. The country receives
 substantial amounts of humanitarian aid from the international
 community.

 of the population but supplies only about 50% of food needs and
 accounts for only 5% of GDP. Subsistence farming and cattle raising
 predominate. The driving force behind the rapid economic growth of the
 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry. This sector, mostly on
 the strength of diamonds, has gone from generating 25% of GDP in 1980
 to 39% in 1994. No other sector has experienced such growth,
 especially not agriculture, which is plagued by erratic rainfall and
 poor soils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25%. Hampered
 by a still sluggish diamond market in 1994, GDP grew by only 1%.

@Brazil:Economy

 Overview: The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing
 sectors, entered the 1990s with declining real growth, runaway
 inflation, an unserviceable foreign debt of $122 billion, and a lack
 of policy direction. In addition, the economy remained highly
 regulated, inward-looking, and protected by substantial trade and
 investment barriers. Ownership of major industrial and mining
 facilities is divided among private interests - including several
 multinationals - and the government. Most large agricultural holdings
 are private, with the government channeling financing to this sector.
 Conflicts between large landholders and landless peasants have
 produced intermittent violence. The COLLOR government, which assumed
 office in March 1990, launched an ambitious reform program that sought
 to modernize and reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices,
 deregulating the economy, and opening it to increased foreign
 competition. Itamar FRANCO, who assumed the presidency following
 President COLLOR's resignation in December 1992, was out of step with
 COLLOR's reform agenda; initiatives to redress fiscal problems,
 privatize state enterprises, and liberalize trade and investment
 policies lost momentum. Galloping inflation - by June 1994 the monthly
 rate had risen to nearly 50% - had undermined economic stability. In
 response, the then finance minister, Fernando Henrique CARDOSO,
 launched the third phase of his stabilization plan, known as Plano
 Real, that called for a new currency, the real, which was introduced
 on 1 July 1994. Inflation subsequently dropped to under 3% per month
 through the end of 1994. The newly elected President CARDOSO has
 called for the implementation of sweeping market-oriented reform,
 including public sector and fiscal reform, privatization,
 deregulation, and elimination of barriers to increased foreign
 investment. Brazil's natural resources remain a major, long-term
 economic strength.

@British Virgin Islands:Economy

 Overview: The economy, one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean
 area, is highly dependent on the tourist industry, which generates
 about 21% of the national income. In 1985 the government offered
 offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the
 islands, and, in consequence, incorporation fees generated about $2
 million in 1987. The economy slowed in 1991 because of the poor
 performances of the tourist sector and tight commercial bank credit.
 Livestock raising is the most significant agricultural activity. The
 islands' crops, limited by poor soils, are unable to meet food
 requirements.

@Bulgaria:Economy

 Overview: The Bulgarian economy continued its painful adjustment in
 1994 from the misdirected development undertaken during four decades
 of Communist rule. Many aspects of a market economy have been put in
 place and have begun to function, but much of the economy, especially
 the industrial sector, has yet to re-establish market links lost with
 the collapse of the other centrally planned Soviet Bloc economies. The
 prices of many imported industrial inputs, especially energy products,
 have risen markedly, and falling real wages have not sufficed to
 restore competitiveness. The government plans more extensive
 privatization in 1995 to improve the management of enterprises and to
 encourage foreign investment. Bulgaria resumed payments on its $10
 billion in commercial debt in 1993 following the negotiation of a 50%
 write-off.

@Burkina:Economy

 Overview: One of the poorest countries in the world, Burkina has a
 high population density and a high population growth rate, few natural
 resources, and a fragile soil. Economic development is hindered by a
 poor communications network within a landlocked country. Agriculture
 provides about 40% of GDP and is mainly of a subsistence nature.
 Industry, dominated by unprofitable government-controlled
 corporations, accounts for about 15% of GDP. Following the 50%
 currency devaluation in January 1994, the government updated its
 development program in conjunction with international agencies. Even
 with the best of plans, however, the government faces formidable
 problems on all sides.

@Burma:Economy

 Overview: Burma has a mixed economy with about 75% private activity,
 mainly in agriculture, light industry, and transport, and with about
 25% state-controlled activity, mainly in energy, heavy industry, and
 foreign trade. Government policy in the last six years, 1989-94, has
 aimed at revitalizing the economy after four decades of tight central
 planning. Thus, private activity has markedly increased; foreign
 investment has been encouraged, so far with moderate success; and
 efforts continue to increase the efficiency of state enterprises.
 Published estimates of Burma's foreign trade are greatly understated
 because of the volume of black market trade. A major ongoing problem
 is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal stability. Although
 Burma remains a poor Asian country, its rich resources furnish the
 potential for substantial long-term increases in income, exports, and
 living standards.

@Burundi:Economy

 Overview: A landlocked, resource-poor country in an early stage of
 economic development, Burundi since October 1993 has suffered from
 massive ethnic-based violence that has displaced an estimated million
 people, disrupted production, and set back needed reform programs.
 Burundi is predominately agricultural with roughly 90% of the
 population dependent on subsistence agriculture. Its economic health
 depends on the coffee crop, which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange
 earnings. The ability to pay for imports therefore continues to rest
 largely on the vagaries of the climate and the international coffee
 market. As part of its economic reform agenda, launched in February
 1991 with IMF and World Bank support, Burundi is trying to diversify
 its agricultural exports, attract foreign investment in industry, and
 modernize government budgetary practices. Although the government
 remains committed to reforms, it fears new austerity measures would
 add to ethnic tensions.

@Cambodia:Economy

 Overview: The Cambodian economy - virtually destroyed by decades of
 war - is slowly recovering. Government leaders are moving toward
 restoring fiscal and monetary discipline and have established good
 working relations with international financial institutions. Growth,
 starting from a low base, has been strong in 1991-94. Despite such
 positive developments, the reconstruction effort faces many tough
 challenges because of the persistence of internal political divisions
 and the related lack of confidence of foreign investors. Rural
 Cambodia, where 90% of about 9.5 million Khmer live, remains mired in
 poverty. The almost total lack of basic infrastructure in the
 countryside will hinder development and will contribute to a growing
 imbalance in growth between urban and rural areas over the near term.
 Moreover, the government's lack of experience in administering
 economic and technical assistance programs and rampant corruption
 among officials will slow the growth of critical public sector
 investment. Inflation for 1994 as a whole was less than a quarter of
 the 1992 rate and was declining during the year.

@Cameroon:Economy

 Overview: Because of its offshore oil resources and favorable
 agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed, most
 diversified primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still,
 it faces many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped
 countries, such as political instability, a top-heavy civil service,
 and a generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise. The
 development of the oil sector led rapid economic growth between 1970
 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986, precipitated by steep
 declines in the prices of major exports: coffee, cocoa, and petroleum.
 Export earnings were cut by almost one-third, and inefficiencies in
 fiscal management were exposed. In 1990-93, with support from the IMF
 and World Bank, the government began to introduce reforms designed to
 spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, and
 recapitalize the nation's banks. Political instability, following
 suspect elections in 1992, brought IMF/WB structural adjustment to a
 halt. Although the 50% devaluation of the currency in January 1994
 improved the potential for export growth, mismanagement remains and is
 the main barrier to economic improvement.

@Canada:Economy

 Overview: As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today
 closely resembles the US in per capita output, market-oriented
 economic system, and pattern of production. Since World War II the
 impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors
 has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one
 primarily industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada registered one of
 the highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations, averaging
 about 3.2%. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force, and
 modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects,
 although the country still faces high unemployment and a growing debt.
 Moreover, the continuing constitutional impasse between English- and
 French-speaking areas has observers discussing a possible split in the
 confederation; foreign investors have become edgy.

@Cape Verde:Economy

 Overview: Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural
 resource base, serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles of
 long-term drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is service
 oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for
 60% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural
 areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 20%; the fishing sector
 accounts for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing
 potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. Cape Verde
 annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by remittances from
 emigrants and foreign aid, which form important supplements to GDP.
 Economic reforms, launched by the new democratic government in 1991,
 are aimed at developing the private sector and attracting foreign
 investment to diversify the economy. Prospects for 1995 depend heavily
 on the maintenance of aid flows, remittances, and the momentum of the
 government's development program.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $410 million (1993

 Agriculture: accounts for 20% of GDP (including fishing); largely
 subsistence farming; bananas are the only export crop; other crops -
 corn, beans, sweet potatoes, coffee; growth potential of agricultural
 sector limited by poor soils and scanty rainfall; annual food imports
 required; fish catch provides for both domestic consumption and small
 exports

@Central African Republic:Economy

 Overview: Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry, remains the
 backbone of the CAR economy, with more than 70% of the population
 living in outlying areas. The agricultural sector generates about half
 of GDP. Timber has accounted for about 26% of export earnings and the
 diamond industry for 54%. Important constraints to economic
 development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor
 transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy of
 misdirected macroeconomic policies. A major plus is the large forest
 reserves, which the government is moving to protect from
 overexploitation. The 50% devaluation of the currencies of 14
 Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had mixed effects on
 CAR's economy. While diamond, timber, coffee, and cotton exports
 increased - leading GDP to increase by 5.5% - inflation rose to 40%,
 fueled by the rising prices of imports on which the economy depends.
 CAR's poor resource base and primitive infrastructure will keep it
 dependent on multilateral donors and France for the foreseeable
 future.

@Chad:Economy

 Overview: Climate, geographic remoteness, poor resource endowment, and
 lack of infrastructure make Chad one of the most underdeveloped
 countries in the world. Its economy is hobbled by political turmoil,
 conflict with Libya, drought, and food shortages. Consequently the
 economy has shown little progress in recent years in overcoming a
 severe setback brought on by civil war in the late 1980s. More than
 80% of the work force is involved in subsistence farming and fishing.
 Cotton is the major cash crop, accounting for at least half of
 exports. Chad is highly dependent on foreign aid, especially food
 credits, given chronic shortages in several regions. Of all the
 Francophone countries in Africa, Chad has benefited the least from the
 50% devaluation of their currencies on 12 January 1994. Despite an
 increase in external financial aid and favorable price increases for
 cotton - the primary source of foreign exchange - the corrupt and
 enfeebled government bureaucracy continues to dampen economic
 enterprise by neglecting payments to domestic suppliers and public
 sector salaries. Oil production in the Lake Chad area remains a
 distant prospect and the subsistence-driven economy probably will
 continue to limp along in the near term.

@Chile:Economy

 Overview: Chile has a prosperous, essentially free market economy,
 with the degree of government intervention varying according to the
 philosophy of the different regimes. Under the center-left government
 of President AYLWIN, which took power in March 1990, spending on
 social welfare rose steadily. At the same time business investment,
 exports, and consumer spending also grew substantially. The new
 president, FREI, who took office in March 1994, has emphasized social
 spending even more. Growth in 1991-94 has averaged 6.5% annually, with
 an estimated one million Chileans having moved out of poverty in the
 last four years. Copper remains vital to the health of the economy;
 Chile is the world's largest producer and exporter of copper. Success
 in meeting the government's goal of sustained annual growth of 5%
 depends on world copper prices, the level of confidence of foreign
 investors and creditors, and the government's own ability to maintain
 a conservative fiscal stance.

@China:Economy

 Overview: Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been
 trying to move the economy from the sluggish Soviet-style centrally
 planned economy to a more productive and flexible economy with market
 elements, but still within the framework of monolithic Communist
 control. To this end the authorities switched to a system of household
 responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization,
 increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in
 industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in
 services and light manufacturing, and opened the economy to increased
 foreign trade and investment. The result has been a strong surge in
 production, particularly in agriculture in the early 1980s. Industry
 also has posted major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong
 Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment and modern
 production methods have helped spur production of both domestic and
 export goods. Aggregate output has more than doubled since 1978. On
 the darker side, the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid
 system the worst results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude,
 corruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up
 inflation). Beijing thus has periodically backtracked, retightening
 central controls at intervals. In 1992-94 annual growth of GDP
 accelerated, particularly in the coastal areas - to more than 10%
 annually according to official claims. In late 1993 China's leadership
 approved additional long-term reforms aimed at giving more play to
 market-oriented institutions and at strengthening the center's control
 over the financial system. In 1994 strong growth continued in the
 widening market-oriented areas of the economy. At the same time, the
 government struggled to (a) collect revenues due from provinces,
 businesses, and individuals; (b) keep inflation within bounds; (c)
 reduce extortion and other economic crimes; and (d) keep afloat the
 large state-owned enterprises, most of which had not participated in
 the vigorous expansion of the economy. From 60 to 100 million surplus
 rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities, many
 barely subsisting through part-time low-pay jobs. Popular resistance,
 changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres have
 weakened China's population control program, which is essential to the
 nation's long-term economic viability. One of the most dangerous
 long-term threats to continued rapid economic growth is the
 deterioration in the environment, notably air pollution, soil erosion,
 and the steady fall of the water table especially in the north.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $2.9788 trillion
 (1994 estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992 by
 use of official Chinese growth statistics for 1993-94; because of the
 difficulties with official statistics in this time of rapid change,
 the result may overstate China's GDP by as much as 25%)

@Colombia:Economy

 Overview: Colombia's economy has grown steadily since 1991, when the
 government implemented sweeping economic reform measures. President
 SAMPER, who took office in August 1994, has pledged to maintain those
 reforms while expanding government assistance for poor Colombians, who
 continue to make up about 40% of the population. In an effort to bring
 down inflation, SAMPER has arranged a "social pact" with business and
 labor to curtail price hikes and trim inflation to 18%. The rapid
 development of oil, coal, and other nontraditional industries, along
 with copious inflows of capital and strengthening of prices for
 coffee, have helped keep growth at 5%-6%. Development of the massive
 Cusiana oilfield provides the means to sustain this level over the
 next several years. Exporters say, however, that their sales have been
 hampered by the appreciation of the Colombian peso, and farmers have
 sought government help in adjusting to greater foreign competition.
 Moreover, increased foreign investment and even greater domestic
 growth have been hindered by an inadequate energy and transportation
 infrastructure and by violence stemming from drug trafficking and
 persistent rural insurgency.

@Comoros:Economy

 Overview: One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of
 several islands that have poor transportation links, a young and
 rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low
 educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence
 level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence
 on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture, including
 fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the leading sector of the economy.
 It contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and
 provides most of the exports. The country is not self-sufficient in
 food production; rice, the main staple, accounts for 90% of imports.
 The government is struggling to upgrade education and technical
 training, to privatize commercial and industrial enterprises, to
 improve health services, to diversify exports, and to reduce the high
 population growth rate. Continued foreign support is essential if the
 goal of 4% annual GDP growth is to be reached in the late 1990s.

@Congo:Economy

 Overview: Congo's economy is a mixture of village agriculture and
 handicrafts, an industrial sector based largely on oil, support
 services, and a government characterized by budget problems and
 overstaffing. A reform program, supported by the IMF and World Bank,
 ran into difficulties in 1990-91 because of problems in changing to a
 democratic political regime and a heavy debt-servicing burden. Oil has
 supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing about
 two-thirds of government revenues and exports. In the early 1980s
 rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to finance large-scale
 development projects with growth averaging 5% annually, one of the
 highest rates in Africa. Subsequently, growth has slowed to an average
 of roughly 1.5% annually, only two-thirds of the population growth
 rate. Political turmoil and misguided government investment have
 derailed economic reform programs sponsored by the IMF and World Bank.

@Cook Islands:Economy

 Overview: Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export
 earners are fruit, copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are
 limited to a fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories.
 Economic development is hindered by the isolation of the islands from
 foreign markets and a lack of natural resources and good
 transportation links. A large trade deficit is annually made up for by
 remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid, largely from New
 Zealand. Current economic development plans call for exploiting the
 tourism potential and expanding the fishing industry.

@Cote D'ivoire:Economy

 Overview: Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest producers and
 exporters of coffee, cocoa beans, and palm-kernel oil. Consequently,
 the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international
 prices for coffee and cocoa and to weather conditions. Despite
 attempts by the government to diversify, the economy is still largely
 dependent on agriculture and related industries. After several years
 of lagging performance, the Ivorian economy began a comeback in 1994,
 due to improved prices for cocoa and coffee, growth in non-traditional
 primary exports such as pineapples and rubber, trade and banking
 liberalization, offshore oil and gas discoveries, and generous
 external financing and debt rescheduling by multilateral lenders and
 France. The 50% devaluation in January 1994 caused a one time jump in
 the inflation rate. Government adherence to a renewed structural
 adjustment program has led to a budget surplus for the first time in
 several years, a smaller personnel budget, and an increase in public
 investment. While real growth in 1994 was only 1.5%, the IMF and World
 Bank expect it will surpass 6% in 1995.

@Croatia:Economy

 Overview: Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic of
 Croatia, after Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized
 area, with a per capita output perhaps one-third above the Yugoslav
 average. At present, Croatian Serb Separatists control approximately
 one-third of the Croatian territory, and one of the overriding
 determinants of Croatia's long-term political and economic prospects
 will be the resolution of this territorial dispute. Croatia faces
 serious economic problems stemming from: the legacy of longtime
 Communist mismanagement of the economy; large foreign debt; damage
 during the fighting to bridges, factories, power lines, buildings, and
 houses; the large refugee population, both Croatian and Bosnian; and
 the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former
 Yugoslav republics, as well as within its own territory. At the
 minimum, extensive Western aid and investment, especially in the
 tourist and oil industries, would seem necessary to revive the
 moribund economy. However, peace and political stability must come
 first; only then will recent government moves toward a
 "market-friendly" economy restore old levels of output. As of February
 1995, fighting continues among Croats, Serbs, and Muslims, and
 national boundaries and final political arrangements are still in
 doubt.

@Cuba:Economy

 Overview: Cuba's heavily statist economy remains severely depressed as
 the result of its own inefficiencies and the loss of massive amounts
 of economic aid from the former Soviet Bloc. Total output in 1994 was
 only about half the output of 1989. The fall in output and in imports
 is reflected in the deterioration of food supplies, shortages of
 electricity, inability to get spare parts, and the replacement of
 motor-driven vehicles by bicycles and draft animals. Higher world
 market prices for sugar and nickel in 1994, however, resulted in a
 slight increase in export earnings for the first time in six years,
 despite lower production of both commodities. The growth of tourism
 slowed in late 1994 as a result of negative publicity surrounding the
 exodus of Cubans from the island and other international factors. The
 government continued its aggressive search for foreign investment and
 announced preliminary agreements to form large joint ventures with
 Mexican investors in telecommunications and oil refining. In mid-1994,
 the National Assembly began introducing several new taxes and price
 increases to stem growing excess liquidity and restore some of the
 peso's value as a monetary instrument. In October the government
 attempted to stimulate food production by permitting the sale of any
 surplus production (over state quotas) at unrestricted prices at
 designated markets. Similar but much smaller markets were also
 introduced for the sale of manufactured goods in December. The various
 government measures have influenced a remarkable appreciation of the
 black market value of the peso, from more than 100 pesos to the dollar
 in September 1994 to 40 pesos to the dollar in early 1995. Policy
 discussions continue in the bureaucracy over the proper pace and scope
 of economic reform.

@Cyprus:Economy

 Overview: The Greek Cypriot economy is small, diversified, and
 prosperous. Industry contributes 14% to GDP and employs 29% of the
 labor force, while the service sector contributes 53% to GDP and
 employs 57% of the labor force. An average 6.8% rise in real GDP
 between 1986 and 1990 was temporarily checked in 1991, because of the
 adverse effects of the Gulf war on tourism. After surging 8.5% in
 1992, growth slowed to 2.0% in 1993 - its lowest level in two decades
 - because of the decline in tourist arrivals associated with the
 recession in Western Europe, Cyprus' main trading partner, and the
 loss in export competitiveness due to a sharp rise in unit labor
 costs. Real GDP is likely to have picked up in 1994, and inflation is
 estimated to have risen to between 5% and 6%. The Turkish Cypriot
 economy has less than one-third the per capita GDP of the south.
 Because it is recognized only by Turkey, it has had much difficulty
 arranging foreign financing, and foreign firms have hesitated to
 invest there. The economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture,
 which employs one-quarter of the work force. Moreover, because the
 Turkish lira is legal tender, the Turkish Cypriot economy has suffered
 the same high inflation as mainland Turkey. The small, vulnerable
 economy is estimated to have experienced a sharp drop in growth during
 1994 because of the severe economic crisis affecting the mainland. To
 compensate for the economy's weakness, Turkey provides direct and
 indirect aid to nearly every sector; financial support has risen in
 value to about one-third of Turkish Cypriot GDP.

@Czech Republic:Economy

 Overview: The government of the Czech Republic, using successful
 stabilization policies to bolster its claims to full membership in the
 western economic community, has reduced inflation to 10%, kept
 unemployment at 3%, balanced the budget, run trade surpluses, and
 reoriented exports to the EU since the breakup of the Czechoslovak
 federation on 1 January 1993. GDP grew 2% in 1994 after stagnating in
 1993 and contracting nearly 20% since 1990. Prague's mass
 privatization program, including its innovative distribution of
 ownership shares to Czech citizens via 'coupon vouchers,' has made the
 most rapid progress in Eastern Europe. When coupon shares are
 distributed in early 1995, 75%-80% of the economy will be in private
 hands or partially privatized, according to the Czech government.
 Privatized companies still face major problems in restructuring; the
 number of annual bankruptcies quadrupled in 1994. In September 1994,
 Prague repaid $471 million in IMF loans five years ahead of schedule,
 making the Czech Republic the first East European country to pay off
 all IMF debts. Despite these outlays, hard-currency reserves in the
 banking system totaled more than $8.5 billion in October. Standard &
 Poor's boosted the Republic's credit rating to BBB+ in mid-1994 - up
 from a BBB rating that was already two steps higher than Hungary's and
 one step above Greece's rating. Prague forecasts a balanced budget, at
 least 3% GDP growth, 5% unemployment, and single-digit inflation for
 1995. Inflationary pressures - primarily as a result of foreign bank
 lending to Czech enterprises but perhaps also due to eased currency
 convertibility controls - are likely to be the most troublesome issues
 in 1995. Continuing economic recovery in Western Europe should boost
 Czech exports and production but a substantial increase in prices
 could erode the Republic's comparative advantage in low wages and
 exchange rates. Prague already took steps in 1994 to increase control
 over banking policies to neutralize the impact of foreign inflows on
 the money supply. Although Czech unemployment is currently the lowest
 in Central Europe, it will probably increase 1-2 percentage points in
 1995 as large state firms go bankrupt or are restructured and service
 sector growth slows.

@Denmark:Economy

 Overview: This thoroughly modern economy features high-tech
 agriculture, up-to-date small-scale and corporate industry, extensive
 government welfare measures, comfortable living standards, and high
 dependence on foreign trade. Denmark is self-sufficient in food
 production. The new center-left coalition government will concentrate
 on reducing the persistent high unemployment rate and the budget
 deficit as well as following the previous government's policies of
 maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus. In the face
 of recent international market pressure on the Danish krone, the
 coalition has also vowed to maintain a stable currency. The coalition
 hopes to lower marginal income taxes while maintaining overall tax
 revenues; boost industrial competitiveness through labor market and
 tax reforms and increased research and development funds; and improve
 welfare services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays.
 Prime Minister RASMUSSEN's reforms will focus on adapting Denmark to
 the criteria for European integration by 1999; although Copenhagen has
 won from the European Union (EU) the right to opt out of the European
 Monetary Union (EMU) if a national referendum rejects it. Denmark is,
 in fact, one of the few EU countries likely to fit into the EMU on
 time. Denmark is weathering the current worldwide slump better than
 many West European countries. After posting 4.5% real GDP growth in
 1994, Copenhagen is predicting a continued strong showing in 1995,
 with real GDP up by 3.2%. The government expects an upswing in
 business investment in 1995 to drive economic growth. Although
 unemployment is high, it remains stable compared to most European
 countries.

@Djibouti:Economy

 Overview: The economy is based on service activities connected with
 the country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in
 northeast Africa. Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital
 city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders. Scanty rainfall
 limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most food must be
 imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the
 region and an international transshipment and refueling center. It has
 few natural resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore,
 heavily dependent on foreign assistance (an important supplement to
 GDP) to help support its balance of payments and to finance
 development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30% continues to be
 a major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over
 the last six years because of recession, civil war, and a high
 population growth rate (including immigrants and refugees).

@Dominica:Economy

 Overview: The economy is dependent on agriculture and thus is highly
 vulnerable to climatic conditions. Agriculture accounts for about 30%
 of GDP and employs 40% of the labor force. Principal products include
 bananas, citrus, mangoes, root crops, and coconuts. Development of the
 tourist industry remains difficult because of the rugged coastline and
 the lack of an international airport. In 1994 a tropical storm
 devastated the banana industry.

@Dominican Republic:Economy

 Overview: The Dominican economy showed some signs of slippage in 1994,
 although its overall performance in recent years has been relatively
 strong. After posting an increase of nearly 8% in 1992, GDP growth
 fell to 3% in 1993 and 1994 as mining output decreased and erosion of
 real wages caused private consumption to decline. A pre-election boost
 in government spending in early 1994 led to the first government
 deficit in four years and bumped inflation up to 14% for the year.

@Ecuador:Economy

 Overview: Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural
 areas. Growth has been uneven in recent years because of fluctuations
 in prices for Ecuador's primary exports - oil and bananas - as well as
 because of government policies designed to curb inflation. President
 Sixto DURAN-BALLEN launched a series of macroeconomic reforms when he
 came into office in August 1992 which included raising domestic fuel
 prices and utility rates, eliminating most subsidies, and bringing the
 government budget into balance. These measures helped to reduce
 inflation from 55% in 1992 to 25% in 1994. DURAN-BALLEN has a much
 more favorable attitude toward foreign investment than his predecessor
 and has supported several laws designed to encourage foreign
 investment. Ecuador has implemented free or complementary trade
 agreements with Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, as well
 as applied for World Trade Organization membership. Ecuador signed a
 standby agreement with the IMF and rescheduled its $7.6 billion
 commercial debt in 1994 thereby regaining access to multilateral
 lending. Growth in 1994 speeded up to 3.9%, based on increased exports
 of bananas and non-traditional products, while international reserves
 increased to a record $1.6 billion.

@Egypt:Economy

 Overview: Half of Egypt's GDP originates in the public sector, most
 industrial plants being owned by the government. Overregulation holds
 back technical modernization and foreign investment. Even so, the
 economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but in
 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden
 of debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for
 balance-of-payments support. Egypt's first IMF standby arrangement
 concluded in mid-1987 was suspended in early 1988 because of the
 government's failure to adopt promised reforms. Egypt signed a
 follow-on program with the IMF and also negotiated a structural
 adjustment loan with the World Bank in 1991. In 1991-93 the government
 made solid progress on administrative reforms such as liberalizing
 exchange and interest rates but resisted implementing major structural
 reforms like streamlining the public sector. As a result, the economy
 has not gained momentum and unemployment has become a growing problem.
 Egypt probably will continue making uneven progress in implementing
 the successor programs with the IMF and World Bank it signed onto in
 late 1993. Tourism has plunged since 1992 because of sporadic attacks
 by Islamic extremists on tourist groups. President MUBARAK has cited
 population growth as the main cause of the country's economic
 troubles. The addition of about 1.2 million people a year to the
 already huge population of 62 million exerts enormous pressure on the
 5% of the land area available for agriculture along the Nile.

@Equatorial Guinea:Economy

 Overview: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing account for about half of
 GDP and nearly all exports. Subsistence farming predominates. Although
 pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for
 hard currency earnings, the deterioration of the rural economy under
 successive brutal regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led
 growth. A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the
 international donor community have failed to revitalize export
 agriculture. Businesses for the most part are owned by government
 officials and their family members. Commerce accounts for about 8% of
 GDP and the construction, public works, and service sectors for about
 38%. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore,
 manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil exploration, taking place
 under concessions offered to US, French, and Spanish firms, has been
 moderately successful. Increased production from recently discovered
 natural gas fields will provide a greater share of exports in 1995.

@Eritrea:Economy

 Overview: With independence from Ethiopia on 27 April 1993, Eritrea
 faces the bitter economic problems of a small, desperately poor
 African country. Most of the population will continue to depend on
 subsistence farming. Domestic output is substantially augmented by
 worker remittances from abroad. Government revenues come from custom
 duties and income and sales taxes. Eritrea has inherited the entire
 coastline of Ethiopia and has long-term prospects for revenues from
 the development of offshore oil, offshore fishing, and tourism. For
 the time being, Ethiopia will be largely dependent on Eritrean ports
 for its foreign trade.

@Estonia:Economy

 Overview: Bolstered by a widespread national desire to reintegrate
 into Western Europe, the Estonian government has pursued an ambitious
 program of market reforms and stabilization measures, which is rapidly
 transforming the economy. Three years after independence - and two
 years after the introduction of the kroon - Estonians are beginning to
 reap tangible benefits; inflation, though still high, was brought down
 to about 2% per month in second half 1994; production declines have
 bottomed out with estimated growth of 4% in 1994; and living standards
 are rising. Economic restructuring has been dramatic. By 1994 the
 service sector accounted for over 55% of GDP, while the once-dominant
 heavy industrial sector continues to shrink. The private sector is
 growing rapidly; the share of the state enterprises in the economy has
 steadily declined and by late 1994 accounted for only about 40% of
 GDP. Estonia's foreign trade has shifted rapidly from East to West;
 the Western industrialized countries now account for two-thirds of
 foreign trade.

@Ethiopia:Economy

 Overview: With the independence of Eritrea on 27 April 1993, Ethiopia
 continues to face difficult economic problems as one of the poorest
 and least developed countries in Africa. Its economy is based on
 agriculture, which accounts for about 45% of GDP, 90% of exports, and
 80% of total employment; coffee generates 60% of export earnings. The
 agricultural sector suffers from frequent periods of drought, poor
 cultivation practices, and deterioration of internal security
 conditions. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs
 from the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but
 less than 10% of agriculture, is state run. The government is
 considering selling off a portion of state-owned plants, and is
 implementing reform measures that are gradually liberalizing the
 economy. A major medium-term problem is the improvement of roads,
 water supply, and other parts of an infrastructure badly neglected
 during years of civil strife.

@Falkland Islands (islas Malvinas):Economy

 Overview: The economy was formerly based on agriculture, mainly sheep
 farming, which directly or indirectly employs most of the work force.
 Dairy farming supports domestic consumption; crops furnish winter
 fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to the UK and the
 sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the
 surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So
 far, efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been
 unsuccessful. The economy has diversified since 1987 when the
 government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
 operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license
 fees total more than $40 million per year and support the island's
 health, education, and welfare system. To encourage tourism, the
 Falkland Islands Development Corporation has built three lodges for
 visitors attracted by the abundant wildlife and trout fishing. The
 islands are now self-financing except for defense. The British
 Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around the
 islands in 1993 and early seismic surveys suggest substantial reserves
 capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day.

@Faroe Islands:Economy

 Overview: The Faroese, who have long enjoyed the affluent living
 standards of the Danes and other Scandinavians, now must cope with the
 decline of the all-important fishing industry and one of the world's
 heaviest per capita external debts of about $25,000. When the nations
 of the world extended their fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the
 early 1970s, the Faroese no longer could continue their traditional
 long-distance fishing and subsequently depleted their own nearby
 fishing areas. The government's tight controls on fish stocks and its
 austerity measures have caused a recession, and subsidy cuts will
 force nationalization in the fishing industry, which has already been
 plagued with bankruptcies. Copenhagen has threatened to withhold its
 annual subsidy of $130 million - roughly one-third of the islands'
 budget revenues - unless the Faroese make significant efforts to
 balance their budget. To this extent the Faroe government is expected
 to continue its tough policies, including introducing a 20%
 value-added tax (VAT) in 1993, and has agreed to an IMF
 economic-political stabilization plan. In addition to its annual
 subsidy, the Danish government has bailed out the second largest Faroe
 bank to the tune of $140 million since October 1992.

@Fiji:Economy

 Overview: Fiji's economy is primarily agricultural, with a large
 subsistence sector. Sugar exports and tourism are the major sources of
 foreign exchange. Industry contributes 13% to GDP, with sugar
 processing accounting for one-third of industrial activity. Roughly
 250,000 tourists visit each year. Political uncertainty and drought,
 however, contribute to substantial fluctuations in earnings from
 tourism and sugar and to the emigration of skilled workers. In 1992,
 growth was approximately 3%, based on growth in tourism and a
 lessening of labor-management disputes in the sugar and gold-mining
 sectors. In 1993, the government's budgeted growth rate of 3% was not
 achieved because of a decline in non-sugar agricultural output and
 damage from Cyclone Kina. Growth in 1994 is estimated to be 5%,
 largely attributed to increased tourism and expansion in domestic
 production, particularly in the manufacturing sector.

@Finland:Economy

 Overview: Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free market
 economy, with per capita output two-thirds of the US figure. Its key
 economic sector is manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, and
 engineering industries. Trade is important, with the export of goods
 representing about 30% of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals,
 Finland depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some
 components for manufactured goods. Because of the climate,
 agricultural development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in
 basic products. Forestry, an important export earner, provides a
 secondary occupation for the rural population. The economy, which
 experienced an average of 4.9% annual growth between 1987 and 1989,
 sank into deep recession in 1991 as GDP contracted by 6.5%. The
 recession - which continued in 1992 with GDP contracting by 4.1% - has
 been caused by economic overheating, depressed foreign markets, and
 the dismantling of the barter system between Finland and the former
 Soviet Union under which Soviet oil and gas had been exchanged for
 Finnish manufactured goods. The Finnish Government has proposed
 efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and efficiency by an
 increase in exports to Western markets, cuts in public expenditures,
 partial privatization of state enterprises, and changes in monetary
 policy. In June 1991 Helsinki had tied the markka to the European
 Union's (EU) European Currency Unit (ECU) to promote stability.
 Ongoing speculation resulting from a lack of confidence in the
 government's policies forced Helsinki to devalue the markka by about
 12% in November 1991 and to indefinitely break the link in September
 1992. The devaluations have boosted the competitiveness of Finnish
 exports. The recession bottomed out in 1993, and Finland participated
 in the general European upturn of 1994. Unemployment probably will
 remain a serious problem during the next few years; the majority of
 Finnish firms face a weak domestic market and the troubled German and
 Swedish export markets. The Finns voted in an October 1994 referendum
 to enter the EU, and Finland officially joined the Union on 1 January
 1995. Increasing integration with Western Europe will dominate the
 economic picture over the next few years.

@France:Economy

 Overview: One of the world's most highly developed economies, France
 has substantial agricultural resources and a diversified modern
 industrial sector. Large tracts of fertile land, the application of
 modern technology, and subsidies have combined to make it the leading
 agricultural producer in Western Europe. Largely self-sufficient in
 agricultural products, France is a major exporter of wheat and dairy
 products. The industrial sector generates about one-quarter of GDP,
 and the growing services sector has become crucial to the economy.
 Following stagnation and recession in 1991-93, French GDP in 1994
 expanded 2.4%. Growth in 1995 is expected to be in the 3.0% to 3.5%
 range. Persistently high unemployment will still pose a major problem
 for the government. Paris remains committed to maintaining the
 franc-deutsche mark parity, which has kept French interest rates high
 despite France's low inflation. Although the pace of economic and
 financial integration within the European Union has slowed down,
 integration presumably will remain a major force shaping the fortunes
 of the various economic sectors over the next few years.

@French Guiana:Economy

 Overview: The economy is tied closely to that of France through
 subsidies and imports. Besides the French space center at Kourou,
 fishing and forestry are the most important economic activities, with
 exports of fish and fish products (mostly shrimp) accounting for more
 than 60% of total revenue in 1992. The large reserves of tropical
 hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an expanding sawmill industry
 that provides sawn logs for export. Cultivation of crops - rice,
 cassava, bananas, and sugarcane - is limited to the coastal area,
 where the population is largely concentrated. French Guiana is heavily
 dependent on imports of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious
 problem, particularly among younger workers.

@Gabon:Economy

 Overview: Notwithstanding its serious ongoing economic problems, Gabon
 enjoys a per capita income more than twice that of most nations of
 sub-Saharan Africa. Gabon depended on timber and manganese until oil
 was discovered offshore in the early 1970s. The oil sector now
 accounts for 50% of GDP. Real growth was feeble in 1992 and Gabon
 continues to face the problem of fluctuating prices for its oil,
 timber, manganese, and uranium exports. Despite an abundance of
 natural wealth, and a manageable rate of population growth, the
 economy is hobbled by poor fiscal management. In 1992, the fiscal
 deficit widened to 2.4% of GDP, and Gabon failed to settle arrears on
 its bilateral debt, leading to a cancellation of rescheduling
 agreements with official and private creditors. Devaluation of its
 Francophone currency by 50% in January 1994 did not set off an
 expected inflationary spiral but the government must continue to keep
 a tight reign on spending and wage increases.

@The Gambia:Economy

 Overview: The Gambia has no important mineral or other natural
 resources and has a limited agricultural base. About 75% of the
 population is engaged in crop production and livestock raising, which
 contribute 30% to GDP. Small-scale manufacturing activity - processing
 peanuts, fish, and hides - accounts for less than 10% of GDP. A
 sustained structural adjustment program, including a liberalized trade
 policy, had fostered a respectable 4% rate of growth in recent years.
 Reexport trade constitutes one-third of economic activity; however,
 border closures associated with Senegal's monetary crisis in late 1993
 led to a halving of reexport trade, reducing government revenues in
 turn. The 50% devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 has made
 Senegalese goods more competitive and apparently prompted a relaxation
 of Senegalese controls, paving the way for a comeback in reexports.
 But overwhelming these developments were the devastating effects of
 the military's takeover in July 1994. By October, traffic at the Port
 of Banjul had fallen precipitously as importers nervously scaled back
 their activities with the commencement of the anticorruption drive by
 the new regime. Concerned with the growing potential for serious
 unrest after a countercoup attempt was bloodily put down by the
 regime, the United Kingdom and the EU in November issued a travelers
 advisory for The Gambia, which brought a halt to tourism almost
 immediately. The Gambia faces additional problems in 1995 if, as is
 likely, economic sanctions by Western governments remain in effect in
 response to indications that the military regime intends to stay in
 power far longer than expected by the donors.

@Gaza Strip:Economy

 Overview: In 1991 roughly 40% of Gaza Strip workers were employed
 across the border by Israeli industrial, construction, and
 agricultural enterprises, with worker remittances supplementing GDP by
 roughly 50%. Gaza depends upon Israel for nearly 90% of its external
 trade. Aggravating the impact of Israeli military administration,
 unrest in the territory since 1988 (intifadah) has raised unemployment
 and lowered the standard of living of Gazans. The Persian Gulf crisis
 and its aftershocks also have dealt blows to Gaza since August 1990.
 Worker remittances from the Gulf states have dropped, unemployment has
 increased, and exports have fallen. The withdrawal of Israel from the
 Gaza Strip in May 1994 brings a new set of adjustment problems.

GEORGIA

 Note--Georgia has been beset by ethnic and civil strife since
 independence. In late 1991, the country's first elected president,
 Zviad GAMSAKHURDIA was ousted in an armed coup. In October 1993,
 GAMSAKHURDIA, and his supporters sponsored a failed attempt to retake
 power from the current government led by former Soviet Foreign
 Minister Eduard SHEVARDNADZE. The Georgian government has also faced
 armed separatist conflicts in the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions.
 A cease-fire went into effect in South Ossetia in June 1992 and a
 joint Georgian-Ossetian-Russian peacekeeping force has been in place
 since that time. Georgian forces were driven out of the Abkhaz region
 in September 1993 after a yearlong war with Abkhaz separatists. Nearly
 200,000 Georgian refugees have since fled Abkhazia, adding
 substantially to the estimated 100,000 internally displaced persons
 already in Georgia. Russian peacekeepers are deployed along the border
 of Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia.

@Georgia:Economy

 Overview: Georgia's economy has traditionally revolved around Black
 Sea tourism; cultivation of citrus fruits, tea, and grapes; mining of
 manganese and copper; and a small industrial sector producing wine,
 metals, machinery, chemicals, and textiles. The country imports the
 bulk of its energy needs, including natural gas and oil products. Its
 only sizable domestic energy resource is hydropower. Since 1990,
 widespread conflicts, e.g., in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and
 Mingreliya, have severely aggravated the economic crisis resulting
 from the disintegration of the Soviet command economy in December
 1991. Throughout 1993 and 1994, much of industry was functioning at
 only 20% of capacity; heavy disruptions in agricultural cultivation
 were reported; and tourism was shut down. The country is precariously
 dependent on US and EU humanitarian grain shipments, as most other
 foods are priced beyond reach of the average citizen. Georgia is also
 suffering from an acute energy crisis, as it is having problems paying
 for even minimal imports. Georgia is pinning its hopes for recovery on
 reestablishing trade ties with Russia and on developing international
 transportation through the key Black Sea ports of P'ot'i and Bat'umi.
 The government began a tenuous program in 1994 aiming to stabilize
 prices and reduce large consumer subsidies.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $6 billion (1994

@Germany:Economy

 Overview: Five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, progress
 towards economic integration between eastern and western Germany is
 clearly visible, yet the eastern region almost certainly will remain
 dependent on subsidies funded by western Germany until well into the
 next century. The staggering $390 billion in western German assistance
 that the eastern states have received since 1990 - 40 times the amount
 in real terms of US Marshall Fund aid sent to West Germany after World
 War II - is just beginning to have an impact on the eastern German
 standard of living, which plummeted after unification. Assistance to
 the east continues to run at roughly $100 billion annually. Although
 the growth rate in the east was much greater than in the west in
 1993-94, eastern GDP per capita nonetheless remains well below
 preunification levels; it will take 10-15 years for the eastern states
 to match western Germany's living standards. The economic recovery in
 the east is led by the construction industries which account for
 one-third of industrial output, with growth increasingly supported by
 the service sectors and light manufacturing industries. Eastern
 Germany's economy is changing from one anchored on manufacturing to a
 more service-oriented economy. Western Germany, with three times the
 per capita output of the eastern states, has an advanced market
 economy and is a world leader in exports. The strong recovery in 1994
 from recession began in the export sector and spread to the investment
 and consumption sectors in response to falling interest rates. Western
 Germany has a highly urbanized and skilled population that enjoys
 excellent living standards, abundant leisure time, and comprehensive
 social welfare benefits. It is relatively poor in natural resources,
 coal being the most important mineral. Western Germany's world-class
 companies manufacture technologically advanced goods. The region's
 economy is mature: services and manufacturing account for the dominant
 share of economic activities, and raw materials and semimanufactured
 goods constitute a large portion of imports.

@Ghana:Economy

 Overview: Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana is relatively
 well off, having twice the per capita output of the poorer countries
 in West Africa. Heavily reliant on international assistance, Ghana has
 made steady progress in liberalizing its economy since 1983. Overall
 growth continued at a rate of approximately 5% in 1994, due largely to
 increased gold, timber, and cocoa production - major sources of
 foreign exchange. The economy, however, continues to revolve around
 subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 45% of GDP and employs 55%
 of the work force, mainly small landholders. Public sector wage
 increases, regional peacekeeping commitments, and the containment of
 internal unrest in the underdeveloped north have placed substantial
 demands on the government's budget and have led to inflationary
 deficit financing and a 27% depreciation of the cedi in 1994.

 offshore banking. The British military presence has been severely
 reduced and now only contributes about 11% to the local economy. The
 financial sector accounts for 15% of GDP; tourism, shipping services
 fees, and duties on consumer goods also generate revenue. Because more
 than 70% of the economy is in the public sector, changes in government
 spending have a major impact on the level of employment.

@Greece:Economy

 Overview: Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the basic
 entrepreneurial system overlaid in 1981-89 by a socialist system that
 enlarged the public sector from 55% of GDP in 1981 to about 70% in
 1989. Since then, the public sector has been reduced to about 60% of
 GDP. Tourism continues as a major source of foreign exchange, and
 agriculture is self-sufficient except for meat, dairy products, and
 animal feedstuffs. Over the last decade, real GDP growth has averaged
 1.6% a year, compared with the European Union average of 2.2%.
 Inflation continues to be well above the EU average, and the national
 debt has reached 140% of GDP, the highest in the EU. Prime Minister
 PAPANDREOU will probably make only limited progress correcting the
 economy's problems of high inflation, large budget deficit, and
 decaying infrastructure. His economic program suggests that although
 he will shun his expansionary policies of the 1980s, he will avoid
 tough measures needed to slow inflation or reduce the state's role in
 the economy. He has limited the previous government's privatization
 plans, for example, and has called for generous welfare spending and
 real wage increases. Athens continues to rely heavily on EU aid, which
 recently has amounted to about 6% of GDP. Greece almost certainly will
 not meet the EU's Maastricht Treaty convergence targets of public
 deficit held to 3% of GDP and national debt to 60% of GDP by 1999. Per
 capita GDP has fallen below Portugal's level, the lowest among EU
 members.

@Greenland:Economy

 Overview: Greenland's economic situation at present is difficult.
 Unemployment is increasing, and prospects for economic growth in the
 immediate future are dim. Following the closing of the Black Angel
 lead and zinc mine in 1989, Greenland became almost completely
 dependent on fishing and fish processing, the sector accounting for
 95% of exports. Prospects for fisheries are not bright, as the
 important shrimp catches will at best stabilize and cod catches have
 dropped. Resumption of mining and hydrocarbon activities is not around
 the corner, thus leaving only tourism with some potential for the near
 future. The public sector in Greenland, i.e., the central government
 and its commercial entities and the municipalities, plays a dominant
 role in Greenland accounting for about two-thirds of total employment.
 About half the government's revenues come from grants from the Danish
 Government.

@Guadeloupe:Economy

 Overview: The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry,
 and services. It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and
 imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In
 addition, an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the
 islands. The traditionally important sugarcane crop is slowly being
 replaced by other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50%
 of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root
 crops are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is
 still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly from France.
 Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production. Most
 manufactured goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially
 high among the young.

@Guam:Economy

 Overview: The economy depends mainly on US military spending and on
 revenues from tourism. Over the past 20 years the tourist industry has
 grown rapidly, creating a construction boom for new hotels and the
 expansion of older ones. Visitors numbered about 900,000 in 1992. The
 slowdown in Japanese economic growth has been reflected in less
 vigorous growth in the tourism sector. About 60% of the labor force
 works for the private sector and the rest for government. Most food
 and industrial goods are imported, with about 75% from the US. Guam
 faces the problem of building up the civilian economic sector to
 offset the impact of military downsizing.

 and considerable potential for agricultural development, Guinea
 remains one of the poorest countries in the world. The agricultural
 sector contributes about 40% to GDP and employs 80% of the work force,

 institutions, and the legal framework are needed if the country is to
 move out of poverty. Except in the bauxite industry, foreign
 investment remains minimal.

@Guinea:Economy

 Overview: Guinea-Bissau ranks among the poorest countries in the
 world. Agriculture and fishing are the main economic activities.
 Cashew nuts, peanuts, and palm kernels are the primary exports.
 Exploitation of known mineral deposits is unlikely at present because
 of a weak infrastructure and the high cost of development. With IMF
 support the country is committed to an economic reform program
 emphasizing monetary stability and private sector growth. This process
 will continue at a slow pace because of a heavy foreign debt burden
 and internal constraints.

@Guyana:Economy

 Overview: Guyana, one of the poorest countries in the Western
 Hemisphere, has pushed ahead strongly in 1992-94, with an 8% average
 annual economic growth rate, led by gold mining, and rice, sugar, and
 forestry products for export. Favorable factors include recovery in
 the key agricultural and mining sectors, a more favorable atmosphere
 for business initiative, a more realistic exchange rate, a sharp drop
 in the inflation rate, and the continued support of international
 organizations. Serious underlying economic problems will continue.
 Electric power has been in short supply and constitutes a major
 barrier to future gains in national output. The government will have
 to persist in efforts to manage its large $2.2 billion external debt,
 control inflation, and to extend the privatization program.

@Haiti:Economy

 Overview: About 75% of the population live in abject poverty.
 Agriculture is mainly small-scale subsistence farming and employs
 two-thirds of the work force. The majority of the population does not
 have ready access to safe drinking water, adequate medical care, or
 sufficient food. The lack of employment opportunities remains one of
 the most critical problems facing the economy, along with soil erosion
 and political instability. International trade sanctions in response
 to the September 1991 coup against President ARISTIDE further damaged
 the economy. The restoration of President ARISTIDE, the lifting of
 sanctions in late 1994, and foreign aid will alleviate some economic
 problems. Haiti will continue to depend heavily on foreign aid.

@Honduras:Economy

 Overview: Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western
 Hemisphere. Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy,
 accounts for 28% of GDP, employs 62% of the labor force, and produces
 two-thirds of exports. Productivity remains low. Manufacturing, still
 in its early stages, employs 9% of the labor force, accounts for 15%
 of GDP, and generates 20% of exports. The service sectors, including
 public administration, account for 50% of GDP and employ 20% of the
 labor force. Many basic problems face the economy, including rapid
 population growth, high unemployment, inflation, a lack of basic
 services, a large and inefficient public sector, and the dependence of
 the export sector mostly on coffee and bananas, which are subject to
 sharp price fluctuations. A far-reaching reform program, initiated by
 former President CALLEJAS in 1990 and scaled back by President REINA,
 is beginning to take hold.

@Hong Kong:Economy

 Overview: Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few
 tariffs or nontariff barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food
 and raw materials must be imported. Manufacturing accounts for about
 17% of GDP. Goods and services exports account for about 50% of GDP.
 Real GDP growth averaged a remarkable 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in
 1989-90, and picked up to 4.2% in 1991, 5.0% in 1992, 5.2% in 1993,
 and 5.5% in 1994. Unemployment, which has been declining since the
 mid-1980s, is now about 2%. A shortage of labor continues to put
 upward pressure on prices and the cost of living. Prospects for
 1995-96 remain bright so long as major trading partners continue to be
 reasonably prosperous and so long as investors feel China will support
 free market practices after the takeover in 1997.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $136.1 billion (1994
 est.)

@Hungary:Economy

 Overview: Since 1989 Hungary has been a leader in the transition from
 a socialist command economy to a market economy - thanks in large part
 to its initial economic reforms during the Communist era. The private
 sector now accounts for about 55% of GDP. Nonetheless, the
 transformation is proving difficult, and many citizens say life was
 better under the old system. On the bright side, the four-year decline
 in output finally ended in 1994, as real GDP increased an estimated
 3%. This growth helped reduce unemployment to just over 10% by
 yearend, down from a peak of 13%. However, no progress was made
 against inflation, which remained stuck at about 20%, and the
 already-large current account deficit in the balance of payments
 actually got worse, reaching almost $4 billion. Underlying Hungary's
 other economic problems is the large budget deficit, which probably
 exceeded 7% of GDP in 1994, despite some late-year budget cutting by
 the new leftist government. In 1995 the government has pledged to
 accelerate privatization and lower the budget deficit to 5.5% of GDP.
 It believes this fiscal tightening will reduce the current account
 deficit to $2.5 billion but at the cost of holding economic growth to
 only 1%.

@Iceland:Economy

 Overview: Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically
 capitalistic, but with an extensive welfare system, relatively low
 unemployment, and comparatively even distribution of income. The
 economy is heavily dependent on the fishing industry, which provides
 nearly 75% of export earnings and employs 12% of the work force. In
 the absence of other natural resources - except energy - Iceland's
 economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices. The economy, in
 recession since 1988, began to recover in 1993, posting 0.4% growth,
 but was still hampered by cutbacks in fish quotas as well as falling
 world prices for its main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum,
 and ferrosilicon. Real GDP grew by perhaps 2.4% in 1994. The
 center-right government plans to continue its policies
